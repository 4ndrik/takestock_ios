<br>Many businesses in large distributed industries
have a problem with stock being unwanted in one location and desired somewhere
else. Takestock.com was created to be an online trading platform to make it
easy for owners of stock to sell their unwanted items and to find a buyer
efficiently rather than turning to scrap as an option. Takestock is initially
focussing on the food manufacturing &amp; agricultural sectors where 600,000 tonnes of food are wasted each year in the UK alone. &nbsp;<br><span><br>We are an&nbsp;eCommerce&nbsp;platform and believe the future
    solution to distributed unwanted stock is an e market place. That is why we do
    not advertise on behalf of brands, publish content or produce editorials for
    the trades we operate in. We focus&nbsp;on trading and helping you turn unwanted
    stock into cash. Takestock was set up by 4 founders who have a wide range of
    experience across multiple tech &amp; food sectors. We think it is unacceptable
    that nearly £1Bn in food is wasted each year in the UK and we intend to make an
    impact on that at Takestock.</span><br><span><br>We think it is unacceptable that nearly £5Bn in food is wasted each year in the UK and we intend to make an impact on that at Takestock."</span></div>
